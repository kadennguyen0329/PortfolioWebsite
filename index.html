                <p>I am always seeking new real-world experiences that will hone my technological skills in critical thinking, collaboration, and practical implementation of ideas. I constantly strive to apply my knowledge in meaningful ways that make a tangible impact and hope to continually evolve as a problem-solver and innovator, using my creativity and technical expertise.</p>

                    <h3>SWE Intern</h3>
                    <p>I developed a React.js user interface for an AI application, allowing for efficient filtering and sorting of over 7,000 uploaded documents, which improved document processing speed by 60%. Additionally, I utilized Spring Boot to program a REST API microservice that streamlined task management, reducing task handling time by 20%. To ensure a consistent and visually appealing user experience, I applied SCSS to style the front-end of the application, resulting in a 25% increase in user satisfaction based on feedback from over 10 testers. Throughout the project, I collaborated with a team of six interns, effectively breaking down complex features into manageable tasks.

                    <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
                    <p>I worked with Professor Arsalan Heydarian, contributing to research efforts commissioned by the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration. I leveraged Unity3D to build immersive VR simulations of cycling environments within Charlottesville, VA, enhancing the speed of behavioral research data collection by 80%. Additionally, I implemented C# scripting to manipulate in-simulation elements, such as bike lane presence and roundabout configurations, which increased study efficiency by 30%. I also utilized Unity ProBuilder for efficient 3D modeling of roundabouts, incorporating variable features like standard and protected bike lanes.

                    <h3>Programming Team</h3>
                    <p>I created robot control software using WPILib, a Java framework designed specifically for FRC robots. Working with a team of programmers, we divided and assigned tasks to integrate electronic components such as motors, sensors, and cameras, and utilized computer vision libraries, which improved the robotâ€™s accuracy by 35%. I applied object-oriented programming principles to develop reusable and maintainable subsystems representing distinct robot functionalities, including the drivetrain, manipulator arm, and vision processing. Additionally, I used a command-based architecture to define robot actions by composing subsystem functionalities, promoting modularity and ease of testing.
